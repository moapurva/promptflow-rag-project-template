Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice end to a great fiscal year. Satya, you started out your comments talking about how every customer conversation has the customer asking you about utilizing generative AI technology and how fast they could utilize that generative AI technology. What's the answer? What do you tell them in terms of the pace with which that could get into the marketplace and your customers could start using it? ",29,3
71,MSFT,23,4,"that could get into the marketplace and your customers could start using it? And then for Amy, how should investors think about just the fundamental gross margins behind these generative AI technologies? We understand there's going to be a lot of CapEx to ramp up underneath these, but what should we expect in terms of what the ultimate gross margin looks like underneath all these new generative AI solutions? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. The fundamental guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value or generative AI is to adopt certain solutions. For ",29,11
72,MSFT,23,4,"guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value or generative AI is to adopt certain solutions. For example, GitHub Copilot, in some sense, it's sort of the no brainer to add productivity leverage for all of the software developers in any organization. Whether you're a bank, you're a retailer or you're a software company, it applies to everyone. That's probably one of the things that we are seeing very good even productivity data and great adoption. And then obviously the excitement that there is already around the M365 Copilot. First thing we sort of talked about is how we ourselves are deploying all these copilots across, whether it's Sales Copilot or M365 ",29,19
73,MSFT,23,4,"Copilot. First thing we sort of talked about is how we ourselves are deploying all these copilots across, whether it's Sales Copilot or M365 Copilot or GitHub Copilot, how do you get maximum value out of these horizontal toolchain? And then on top of that, we have taken what we did underneath these products and built it out as a first-class tech stack, which we talked about at our developer conference called the Copilot Stack, and then with Azure AI tooling, made it possible for someone like Moody's or to build their own copilot for their people. To us, we want to be able to help customers build their generative AI applications on top of Azure AI and with speed, if you ",30,6
74,MSFT,23,4,"copilot for their people. To us, we want to be able to help customers build their generative AI applications on top of Azure AI and with speed, if you will. And so, those are the two things that we asked them to identify where they can get the maximum productivity leverage, and then we even swarm with our own resources to help them get those things done. And the last comment I'd make is the cloud and data in the cloud enables all this, because I think the diffusion cycle here is, in some sense, we have a new set of cloud meters that are getting adopted faster because of everything else that came before it in the cloud. Those would be the ",30,14
75,MSFT,23,4,"new set of cloud meters that are getting adopted faster because of everything else that came before it in the cloud. Those would be the observations. AMY HOOD: And to your question, Keith, on gross margins and how I think about those, going forward, the first thing I would say is I expect gross margins here to transition over time, just like they did in the prior cloud transition. I would also say I expect workloads and the gross margins of the workloads to be different, just like they are in the cloud today. I would also add one thing that's different than last time, we've talked a bit about this before, is that we start out in a different place with more of a ",31,1
76,MSFT,23,4,"I would also add one thing that's different than last time, we've talked a bit about this before, is that we start out in a different place with more of a shared platform, which allows us to scale those gross margins a bit faster than last time. And we do expect, as you asked and Satya talked about, the pace of this adoption curve, we do expect to be faster. You're seeing the CapEx spend accelerate in Q4 and then again in Q1. And we've talked about what it should look like the rest of the year. Now that being said, we're talking about all that and going through that transition while delivering in FY24 over FY23, effectively a point higher operating margins, because if it's flat year over year, as we guided, with the ",31,9
77,MSFT,23,4,"transition while delivering in FY24 over FY23, effectively a point higher operating margins, because if it's flat year over year, as we guided, with the headwind from the useful life change, when you correct for that, it's about a point higher. I think the real focus here is being able to be aggressive in meeting the demand curve and focusing on the transition, and growth and gross margins, and delivering the operating leverage.

Satya, on the optimization headwinds that you continue to see, when do you think we hit peak optimization? Are we getting close to hitting that peak and getting some relief in the back half of the year and maybe AI helping provide as a tailwind? Any color from what you're seeing from your perspective would be helpful. SATYA NADELLA: Sure, Brent. Thank you for the question. Yeah, a couple of observations. One is I think overall in the cloud, you do see new project starts and then those project starts get optimized. And then you sort of ",32,5

And then you sort of time series all of that, and that's sort of what you see in the normal course. What happened here was during the pandemic, obviously, there were lots of new projects starts and optimization, in some sense, was postponed. And that's where you're seeing, I'll call it, catch up optimization. And that's something that, to your point, we will lap going into the next couple of quarters - I think it'll come down - and we are seeing new projects starts, both traditional types of projects starts, even cloud migrations, data applications, and of course, obviously, the AI applications.

But we'll get back to, I'll call it, the normal pace of new project starts and optimizations, going forward. But we will cycle through, I think in the next couple of quarters, what is the last catch up optimization. AMY HOOD: I would just add, Brent, I think, to Satya's point, and maybe to build a bit of a line for, I think it felt very similar to last quarter where we made the same comments, which is we're seeing sort of the normal optimization plus we're seeing new workload starts across these workloads Satya talked about. And I think that's what we're saying, going forward, and ",33,1

And then, quickly for Satya, can you give us some status on the general availability of the full copilot development stack and how long it's taking clients and partners to build copilots? Thanks. AMY HOOD: Why don't I start on the CapEx question, Satya, then I'll turn it over to you. ",33,17
83,MSFT,23,4,"AMY HOOD: Why don't I start on the CapEx question, Satya, then I'll turn it over to you. Mark, really, first of all, both in Q4 and then talking about Q1, the acceleration is really quite broad. It's both on the datacenters and the physical basis, plus CPUs and GPUs, and networking equipment. Think of it in a broad sense as opposed to a narrow sense. It's overall increases of acceleration of overall capacity. And I think if you look back over really FY23, you wouldn't have seen some of the pace on normal, what I would say capacity adds, even for the normal Azure workload. You're seeing both accelerations and normal Azure ",34,8
84,MSFT,23,4,"of the pace on normal, what I would say capacity adds, even for the normal Azure workload. You're seeing both accelerations and normal Azure workloads plus some of the Al workloads, is partially the reason. It's why I do comment quite often that it's both overall commercial cloud demand and building out capacity for Al; it's both. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, and I think, just for perspective, I think it's sort of always good to think about it, right, where we have, what, 111 commercial cloud business growing at 22%, year over year. And then you had a CapEx growth which was around the same number, 23%-24%. In some sense, it's sort of replacement capital plus some new capital that is going to drive new ",34,16

That's, I think, the scale, and we feel good about that structure of overall growth rates and how it translates into future TAM opportunity for us. And then, to your other question on how all this translates into project starts effectively, the Copilot Stack is available today on Azure. We have everything from Azure AI toolchain where you can use, obviously, Azure OpenAI, or even you can use open models from LLaMa and other Hugging Face models.

And so, that's something that we're seeing a lot of, and the copilots are fundamentally orchestrations of that. And so, we have all of these services available.

When you take that broader lens, that 21%- 22% growth rate that Satya and Amy referred to, what could be the outlook? Could we be too optimistic in entertaining hopes of some kind of acceleration in the years ahead, or how do you think about that, the outlook on the top line? Thank you so much. ",36,14

Maybe I'll start and then, Amy, you can add because I think we do think about what's the long- term TAM here, right? I mean, you've heard me talk about this as a percentage of GDP. What's going to be tech spend? If you believe that, let's say the 5% of GDP is going to go to 10% of GDP, maybe that gets accelerated because of the AI wave. Then the question is how much of that goes to the various parts of our commercial cloud? And then how competitive are we in each layer, right? ",37,2
91,MSFT,23,4,"goes to the various parts of our commercial cloud? And then how competitive are we in each layer, right? If you sort of break it down, you talked about how Microsoft 365, we think of this copilot as a third pillar, right? We had the creation tools. We then had all the communication and collaboration services, and we think the AI copilot is a third pillar. We are excited about it. Amy talked about how we want to get it out first as part of this preview, and then in the second half of the next fiscal year, we'll start getting some of the real revenue signal from it. We're looking forward to it, but we think of it long term as a third pillar, like we thought about something like, say, Teams or SharePoint back in the ",37,10

Then Azure, the way I think about it is we still are, whatever, inning two or inning three of even the cloud migration, especially if you view it, right, whether by industry moves to the cloud, segment move to the cloud as well as country adoption of the cloud. There's still early innings of the cloud migration itself. There's a lot there still. And then on top of that, there is this completely new world of AI driving a set of new workloads. And so, we think of that, again, being pretty expansive from a TAM ",37,18
93,MSFT,23,4,"completely new world of AI driving a set of new workloads. And so, we think of that, again, being pretty expansive from a TAM opportunity, and we'll play it out. But at the same time, as we are $110- $111 billion commercial cloud that has grown in 20s. And so, therefore, we do hit law of large numbers. But that said, we do think that this is a business that can have sustained high growth, which is something that we are excited about. AMY HOOD: And I think the only thing, Kash, I would add is I think in some ways, what we're really pointing to is there's a process here. We see the demand signal is quite strong; it remains strong. I'm thrilled with all the ",38,6

They reach new budget pools, is almost the way I talk about it a lot in terms of how CIOs or CFOs that I talk to think about that investment, so a growing opportunity. And as you know, we're focused on executing against that. And then revenue is an outcome, but it certainly does require the demand signal, requires the capital expense and then creates the opportunity. And that's ",38,14

In other words, is it a fairly cost intensive new product that we should keep in mind? And also, could it pull along Azure in the sense that you need Azure AD and perhaps some of the other cybersecurity products?

And I absolutely understand we are excited, too, by the demand signal, the customer reaction, really the requests for getting to be in the paid preview. It's all encouraging. As you know, last week, we announced pricing. Then we'll continue to work through the paid preview process, get good feedback. Then we'll announce the general availability date. Then we'll get to the GA date. Then we'll, of course, be able to sell it and then recognize revenue. And that is why I continue to say that I am just as excited as everyone else about this, and it ",39,18

And we've, I think, given you some sizing opportunities and I think I would use all that. But I do think this is really about pacing. And, of course, we've still got to get our Security Copilot and some of the Dynamics workloads priced and released, and we'll continue to work toward that. And, of course, I think one of the things that people often, I think, overlook is, and Satya mentioned it briefly, when you go back to the pull along Azure, I think in many ways, lots of these AI products pull along Azure ",40,6
99,MSFT,23,4,"is, and Satya mentioned it briefly, when you go back to the pull along Azure, I think in many ways, lots of these AI products pull along Azure because it's not just the Al solution services that you need to build an app. And so, it's less about Microsoft 365 pulling it along or any one copilot. It's that when you're building these, it requires data, and it requires the Al services. You'll see them pull both core Azure and Al Azure along with them. And I think that's an important nuance as well. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, and if I could just add to what Amy said, the platform effect here is really all about the extensibility of the copilots. You see that today when people build applications in Teams that are built on ",40,14

You'll see, obviously, a pull through not only on the identity or security layer, but in the core PaaS services of Azure plus the copilot extensibility in M365. KARL KEIRSTEAD: Terrific, thank you.

SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, Judson Althoff would love you for having used his metaphor of remodeling every room of the house with Al, because you're absolutely right. I mean, that's the opportunity we see. I think what you're also referencing is now, there is good empirical evidence and data around the GitHub Copilot and the productivity stats around it. And we're actively working on that for M365 Copilot, also for things like the role-based ones like Sales Copilot, our Service Copilot. We see these business processes having very high productivity gains. ",41,18
103,MSFT,23,4,"like Sales Copilot, our Service Copilot. We see these business processes having very high productivity gains. And so, yes, over the course of the year, we will have all of that evidence. And I think at the end of the day, as Amy referenced, every CFO and CIO is also going to take a look at this. I do think for the first time, or rather, I do think people are going to look at how can they complement their OpEx spend with essentially these copilots in order to drive more efficiency and, quite frankly, even reduce the burden and drudgery of work on their OpEx and their people, and so on. Therefore, I think you're going to see all of that translated into productivity stats, and we're looking forward to getting that ",42,5

MARK MURPHY: Thank you very much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) ALEX ZUKIN, Wolfe Research: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just a multi-part. You mentioned a couple of times that with the Al workload adoption that you're seeing on Azure, it's starting to look maybe a little bit different from an incremental share gain perspective ",42,13
105,MSFT,23,4,"the Al workload adoption that you're seeing on Azure, it's starting to look maybe a little bit different from an incremental share gain perspective versus previous generations. Can you maybe expand upon that? How should that drive for Azure consumption, particularly as we get through the year? And do you see a scenario where either the combination of lapping the optimization headwind plus the AI contribution plus this incremental tailwind that you're seeing around the workloads actually does drive re- acceleration in Azure, particularly in the second half when you're going to start to see some of those things kick in? ",42,21
106,MSFT,23,4,"acceleration in Azure, particularly in the second half when you're going to start to see some of those things kick in? SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, the thing that we are both seeing and excited about is both the new workloads. I mean, if you think about Azure, we have grown Azure over the years, coming from behind. And here we are, as a strong number two in the lead when it comes to these new workloads. For example, we are seeing new logos. Customers who may have used another cloud for most of what they do are, for the first time, sort of starting to use Azure for some of their new AI workloads. We also have even customers who have used multiple clouds, who've used us for a class ",43,8

We also have even customers who have used multiple clouds, who've used us for a class of sort of workloads, also start new projects when it's in data and Al, which they were using other clouds for. What I think you will see us is more share gains, more logo gains, reducing our TAC even. And so, those are the things, the points of leverage. But at the same time, we are not a small business anymore in any of these things. We are of significant scale. And so, yes, we celebrate. That's why we're even giving you the visibility or one point of it showing up this quarter, a couple of points showing up next quarter. And those are material numbers. ",43,16
108,MSFT,23,4,"giving you the visibility or one point of it showing up this quarter, a couple of points showing up next quarter. And those are material numbers. And so, that's kind of what I think we'll track. And I think Amy mentioned it because there are two parts to even the AI, right? There is the models themselves with our partnership with OpenAl. That's sort of one type of spend on compute and the other is much more revenue driven, right, which is we will track the inference costs to the revenue and demand. And you're already seeing both of those play out. ALEX ZUKIN: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Alex. Operator, we have time for one last ",44,3

Satya, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on your comments on data platforms. I think we've heard a lot over the last quarter or so about if you don't have a data strategy, it's tough to have an Al strategy. Can you just talk about where customers are right now in that journey to have a more, I guess, thoughtful data strategy? And what does that mean in ",44,11
110,MSFT,23,4,"Can you just talk about where customers are right now in that journey to have a more, I guess, thoughtful data strategy? And what does that mean in terms of their ability to adopt AI services, meaning do they have to sort of tackle the data issue first before they can really take advantage of all the AI services, or how should we think about that sort of juxtaposition? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question. Yes, absolutely, I think having your data, in particular in the cloud, is sort of key to how you can take advantage of essentially these new AI reasoning engines to complement, I'll call it, your databases, because these Al engines are not databases. But they can reason over your data and to help you then get ",44,19

But they can reason over your data and to help you then get more insights, more completions, more predictions, more summaries and what have you. Those are the things, when we say copilot design pattern, that's sort of what that design pattern is all about. The thing that perhaps even in the last quarter, and I had that in my remarks, is most exciting is how, with Microsoft Fabric, especially for the analytics workloads, we've brought together compute, storage, governance with a very disruptive business model. I mean, to give you a flavor for it, right, you have your data in an Azure data ",45,7
112,MSFT,23,4,"with a very disruptive business model. I mean, to give you a flavor for it, right, you have your data in an Azure data lake. You can bring SQL compute to it. You can bring Spark to it. You can bring Azure AI or Azure OpenAI to it, right? The fact is you have storage separated from all these compute meters, and they're all interchangeable, right? You don't have to buy each of these separately. That's the disruptive business model. I feel that Microsoft is very well positioned with the way our data architecture lays out, our business model around data, and how people will plan to use data with Al services. That's kind of what I mean by getting your ",45,15

Thank you, guys for taking the question, and impressive results in what is obviously a very difficult environment. A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point, but I think this is what's on a lot of investors' minds, is this is two quarters in a row now where Azure constant currency growth came in a little bit below your guidance.

If you could address those, I think it would put a lot of investor minds at ease.

A point here or there, and you've heard me say it when we've been a point better, and you've heard me say it when we've been a point worse. And I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on ",37,8

And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. And as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated, we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are still growing and budgeted spend is still growing.

And yet, you still want to optimize your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth. We saw that across all segments. If there was one segment where I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or mid-sized segment of the market, that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that one point I know that people are focused on. ",38,2

And so, as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number.

How should we think about that, that specific component of the guidance, given the fact that you've got good bookings, strong RPO grow, etcetera? AMY HOOD: Thanks, Mark.

Where we in fact saw - I think we talked about it - new deal moderation, I'd referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well, it tended to be in, to your point, the smaller end of the market, small-to-midsize companies, and it also tended to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent, a little bit and I'd refer to.

And so, we're very excited about it. We have a lot, sort of more to talk about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you'll see more advances on GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area of huge investment. The Al moment clearly has arrived and it's going to be part of every product, whether it's - in fact, you mentioned our Power Platform, because that's another area where we're innovating in terms of ",43,11

Yeah, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability at an infrastructure layer for training and inference. And the model themselves are platforms for third parties. And our first-party applications are getting better because of the use of those AI models. AMY HOOD: And to your question on energy costs, let me try to provide a little bit of help there.

Do you mind talking through that decisions? Why not throttle back OpEx as a counter to that Windows pressure?

The PC market is cyclical, and we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic. And we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line. And you saw substantially increased margins over that time period.

But overall, the Windows app install base, our ability to grow usage, it's still higher than it was. And that's a good opportunity for us. And so, in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom line when we saw a surge, it's important to stay consistent in this down market, because when you have a type of opportunity that we have specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked about as being some of our most exciting, and you have the opportunity with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right? And I think it's important to have a steady hand. ",45,10

Now, let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It'll be about investing where we said we would invest, which is in focused areas. It's about moving headcount to make sure, inside the company, we've got it on the highest and most important things. We've added a lot of headcount over the past 12 months, and we want to make sure we use those headcount in the most productive way possible. And we're going to do that. ",45,18

When we come and lap those, you will see a material decline in OpEx investment. You will also see us start to lap some of the headcount surges that we made last year in key areas. And by then, I feel good that we'll see productivity improvements from the headcount we have and our focus.

I think you're already over 300 million subscribers, so just any color on just the runway from here. Where is the incremental coming from? And with all the work that you're doing with E3, E5 and collaboration security analytics, might we see more of the growth coming from ASP versus subscriber growth over time? Thank you so much.

216,MSFT,23,1,"versus subscriber growth over time? Thank you so much. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brad. It's a good question because you've continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways, because we're focusing on frontline workers scenarios. We're continuing to focus on small and midsize business growth, and we're adding new things to which you can grow, whether that's Viva, whether it's Teams. There's new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value, and then to add seats. And so, I don't want to say it has to be, again, this vision of ""or."" So, I think ",47,7

And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we've added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well. And so, you will see, right, over time, long term, the seat growth move a little bit, and then you'll see ASP show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more RPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1. That had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think ",47,15

Do you see these as largely offsetting factors, or are you expecting the former variable to be a lot more prominent than the latter? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, the way we see it is overall macro will mean that everybody's going to optimize their build.

In fact, as Amy said, our job number one for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer success teams are lined up with them helping customers, quote/unquote, do more with less. So, that's sort of one side. The thing, though, from a customer perspective, the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is to move to the cloud. So, we see the value prop of the cloud. The big winner in all of this will be public cloud, because public cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk. ",48,17

That's where I think a little bit of, as you all think about what happens to cloud, for us, we look at this and say, this is a period where cloud's going to gain share, because we're still in the early innings of adoption.

The second one is the place where we are, again very, very focused on, first starting with our own owned and operated.

And those are things that we are high leverage on top of the installed base that's now structurally changed in terms of grow. And then the third party with Netflix, we're really excited about that.

I want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities. As I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear: Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we're now seeing them optimize that spend. Also, organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty. ",2,14
234,MSFT,23,2,"Also, organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And the next major wave of computing is being born, as we turn the world's most advanced Al models into a new computing platform. In this environment, we remain convicted on three things: This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long term loyalty and share position, while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth. This in turn sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital ",2,22

And lastly we're going to lead in the Al era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts. With that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22 percent and 29 percent in constant currency.

SATYA NADELLA: Thank you so much, Keith, for the questions. As you ",22,23

And we've been actually working very hard on a lot of elements of this partnership over the last three years. And so, I think the way for our investors to see this is we fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave, as I said, is going to be AI. And we strongly also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves, and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack, and also create new solutions and new opportunities.

If you take that lens, the core of Azure or what is considered cloud computing fundamentally changes in its nature and how compute, storage and network come together.

That's sort of, I think, core Azure itself has been transformed and the infrastructure business is being transformed. And so, you can see us with data beyond Azure OpenAI services, even. Think about what Synapse plus OpenAI API's can do. You already have the Power Platform incorporated capability. You can prompt a workflow. I ",23,19

GitHub Copilot is, in fact, I would say the most at-scale LLF-based product out there in the marketplace today. And so, we fully expect us to sort of incorporate AI in every layer of the stack, whether it's in productivity, whether it's in our consumer services.

307,MSFT,23,2,"that perceiving that you were saying it's getting worse, not better. Can you just give us a little more color on that? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brent. First of all, I was making a comment which was sort of a global comment, not just a specific U.S. comment. I mean, I always sort of subscribe to that there's only one law of gravity that I think all of us are subject to, which is inflation-adjusted economic growth in the world, and then how many times that do we grow, because, as I said, even I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be much higher, and on a secular basis. The question is, how many times is it, given the overall inflation adjusted economic growth? That's kind of how I ",24,21
308,MSFT,23,2,"much higher, and on a secular basis. The question is, how many times is it, given the overall inflation adjusted economic growth? That's kind of how I look at it. Given that, I think the two things that we see, we commented on that even in the last quarter, and it's even in the outlook, which is the thing that customers are doing is what they accelerated during the pandemic, they're making sure that they're getting most value out of it or optimizing it, and then also being a bit more cautious on, given the macroeconomic headwinds out there in the market. Given those two things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will ",25,1
309,MSFT,23,2,"headwinds out there in the market. Given those two things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what they'll plow into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up. And so, one of the key things we're watching for, Brent, is to make sure that we are gaining share in this phase through our value propositions, and even build loyalty with our customers so that, long term, we are well positioned for share gain. That's sort of fundamentally how we view it. And then the other aspect, I'd also say, is simultaneously investing in this ",25,9
310,MSFT,23,2,"positioned for share gain. That's sort of fundamentally how we view it. And then the other aspect, I'd also say, is simultaneously investing in this new Al trend, because I don't think any application start that happens next is going to look like the application starts of 2019 or 2020. They're all going to have considerations around how does my AI inference performance cost model is going to look like. And that's where we are well-positioned again. That's how I view it. The market, you all are better readers of, quite frankly, what's happening out there. We can tell you what we see. What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads. And that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis as a ",25,17
311,MSFT,23,2,"optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads. And that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up. BRENT THILL: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much. I'd like to follow up a little bit on this question relating to optimization. I know we saw some slowing this quarter, you're guiding to some slowing next quarter in Cloud and Azure. How much of that is, do you believe at this point, truly people ",25,25
312,MSFT,23,2,"slowing this quarter, you're guiding to some slowing next quarter in Cloud and Azure. How much of that is, do you believe at this point, truly people optimizing what they've already bought, and stepping back before that, versus how much of that is due to macro-factors themselves specifically impacting demand? SATYA NADELLA: I'd say two things, and then, Amy, please feel free to add. One is it absolutely starts with workloads that they have at scale, just because of the visibility one has on what's driving, essentially, the consumption meters. And there's real guidance that we ourselves entered in the product to say, here are things that you could do to optimize your ",26,4
313,MSFT,23,2,"consumption meters. And there's real guidance that we ourselves entered in the product to say, here are things that you could do to optimize your billing. And so, that's sort of what is the fundamental thing. When we say, do more with less, and how can we help, that's sort of the first place customers go to. And then the next piece really, I think, is going to be about how do they take the optimization that they get, and the savings they get in one workload, and what new project starts. And that's where there's a reprioritization. When should we start a new project? Those are the two things that are happening simultaneously. They don't perfectly match, but ",26,12
314,MSFT,23,2,"reprioritization. When should we start a new project? Those are the two things that are happening simultaneously. They don't perfectly match, but one of the things is they're looking to back some savings on some workloads, and then start. That's where, I think, a little bit of what has to happen is a cycle time where the optimization cycle finishes, the projects start, and then the projects ramp. And I think that that's what, at least on the cloud consumption side, you're seeing. And on the per-user side, it's slightly different, which is in per user, also, there was real acceleration in terms of purchases of per-user licenses, ",26,20
315,MSFT,23,2,"And on the per-user side, it's slightly different, which is in per user, also, there was real acceleration in terms of purchases of per-user licenses, whether it is for knowledge workers or frontline workers. And again, they're all now making sure that they're all getting used, and the usage is going up. When we look at our Office 365 usage, all those numbers are up, year over year, in a substantial way. I gave you some of the Teams numbers. In fact, one of the things was what'll happen to Teams usage after pandemic. Guess what? They're up. And so, that's good news. And now, once we cycle through that again, the seats will get added at premium. I'm very, very excited about Teams Pro ",26,28
316,MSFT,23,2,"And so, that's good news. And now, once we cycle through that again, the seats will get added at premium. I'm very, very excited about Teams Pro coming out in a couple of weeks. And those are all things that we will be able to sort of use to ensure that the ARPU are also going up in value. AMY HOOD: And Mark, because I do think it's actually quite hard to separate, from a driver perspective, how much is optimization versus macro, it's all related when you start to say, what's the best ROI I can get on every budget dollar I spend. And our job as a partner to so many of these customers is to help them do that. Satya talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user, ",27,6
317,MSFT,23,2,"customers is to help them do that. Satya talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user, where the way it showed itself is we had very high renewal rates, and very good suite performance at renewal, meaning what we tend to call internally recapture. While we had some more challenges on maybe a standalone sale of a new product, where the cycle is going to be a little longer, you're going to have to show that cost savings. But the suite sale, the value in that showed itself in terms of strong E5. You can see the ARPU growth, and you can see the consistency, potentially, in both renewal rate and frankly within Microsoft 365 performance. ",27,14
318,MSFT,23,2,"can see the consistency, potentially, in both renewal rate and frankly within Microsoft 365 performance. MARK MOERDLER: Perfect, thank you very much. I appreciate it. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Satya, I'm curious if you could talk about how long the cycle time for optimization is. Are we talking a couple of quarters, three quarters or multiple years, because I do take your comment about that tech spending is percentage of global GDP going higher? If that were to happen, how do you frame the duration of ",27,22
319,MSFT,23,2,"take your comment about that tech spending is percentage of global GDP going higher? If that were to happen, how do you frame the duration of this optimization that's happening in the industry? Thank you so much. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, I think that you have a workload, you optimize the workload, and you start a new workload. The thing that I would say is when you're done with optimizing a workload is when you are done with the cycle. I think, if you sort of say, when did we enter this, we accelerated a bunch of workloads during the pandemic over a period of two years. We are optimizing. I don't think we're going to take two years to optimize. But ",28,1
320,MSFT,23,2,"workloads during the pandemic over a period of two years. We are optimizing. I don't think we're going to take two years to optimize. But we're going to take this year to optimize and then, as we optimize, the new project start. The new project starts don't start instantly at the peak usage. They start and then they scale. And so, those are the two cycles that will happen, where there will be a time block. KASH RANGAN: Got it. It's a temporary adjustment before we start to get the full effect of the next set of workloads. Good to get that. SATYA NADELLA: That's correct, that's correct. KASH RANGAN: Thank you. ",28,9
321,MSFT,23,2,"SATYA NADELLA: That's correct, that's correct. KASH RANGAN: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kash. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. This one for Amy. Amy, given the obviously tough environment, it sounds like reaching that full fiscal year 20% constant currency commercial revs guide would be tough. Is that also true for the soft guidance for 10% plus total revenue growth for the year?

Thank you. AMY HOOD: Karl, the first half of your question, give me a second on the second half of your question, which is, is the guide off the exit rate? It's off the exit rate on Azure of 4 to 5 points, just to make sure that is clear.

Outside of that, as you can see, the trends are relatively consistent. In some ways, it's important because when you look at the operating income margin guidance that I talked about, the fact that we're guiding to really only 1 point of margin deceleration for the year on a constant currency basis, with probably over $2 billion of headwind from the OEM business from what we had anticipated heading into the year, the focus on margins, the focus on prioritization, the focus on putting our investments into where we know they have high return, I actually feel quite good about ",29,7

How are you thinking about headcount for the remainder of the year and the possibility for further expense actions, if necessary? And what criteria do you consider in making these decisions? Thanks. AMY HOOD: Brad, listen, thanks for that question. Obviously, as we think about the Q4 guidance around low single-digit operating expense growth, we start to, as you know, sort of lap certain real acceleration points that we had last year, and we lap the acquisitions, both of Nuance and Xander. By the time that gets to the end of Q4, you'll see very moderated headcount ",29,23

And you're right, we take decisions like the one we had to make to get our cost structure more in line with revenue just incredibly seriously, because we have lots of very talented people who were impacted by that. And so, I do think that we feel confident in that exit rate. As I said, it'll certainly imply that year over year growth as we lap some of the investment that we made will be quite small. ",30,2

In Office 365 Commercial, with you guys approaching 400 million seats and the E5 business really starting to accelerate here on that consolidated sort of expense ROI that you're putting forth, should we think about the growth they're more evenly balanced between seats and ARPU, going forward, or are we still to ",30,10

AMY HOOD: That's a good question, especially because this quarter, you started to see a little bit more of that ARPU influence. And as you might have gathered from your question, and I'll just reinforce it, as we see some of these moderating seat growth, whether that's some of the new SKU weakness that we had talked about, some of the standalone stuff, you're starting to also see E5 ARPU happen at the same time. It does create some stability in that Office 365 Commercial revenue number. ",30,18

The value there is just very high for customers in this environment, between analytics, security, and I think we've given some, I think, good security data points in terms of adoption, and voice.

I wanted to ask just about how your visibility has changed in terms of some of the larger Azure customer ramps. Could you just comment to the extent those large customer ramps or if any of those projects are getting put on pause?

332,MSFT,23,2,"the coming quarters? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: On the second piece, I think it's too early to sort of start somehow separating out AI from the rest of the workload. I mean, even the workloads themselves, AI is just going to be a core part of a workload in Azure versus just Al alone. In other words, if you have an application that's using a bunch of inference, let's say, it's also going to have a bunch of storage, and it's going to have a bunch of other compute beyond GPU inferencing, if you will. I think over time, obviously, I think every app is going to be an Al app. That's, I think, the best way to think about this transformation. ",31,21

On your characterization of the large customers, whether there is any changes in that trajectory, I would point back to, I think, some of the common theme around every large customer is looking to optimize the workload that they have at scale today, and plow some of that money back that they save into new project structure. That's sort of what the classic pattern of large customers is. Sometimes, you will have ISVs who are different, right?

IaaS PaaS consumption is really stepped down recently, and it's important to understand the macro versus an optimization that will rebound, whether it's going to rebound ",30,12
410,MSFT,23,3,"really stepped down recently, and it's important to understand the macro versus an optimization that will rebound, whether it's going to rebound quickly or is there a more fundamental issue? In other words, is this simply purely macro, and everyone is stepping back a little bit, and they're going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back, or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that that slowdown to sustain even when the IT spending rebound? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll make three comments. And it's also important, I think, to distinguish between what I would say is macro or absolute performance and relative performance, ",30,20
411,MSFT,23,3,"comments. And it's also important, I think, to distinguish between what I would say is macro or absolute performance and relative performance, because I think that's perhaps a good way to think about how we manage our business. First is optimizations do continue. In fact, we are focused on it. We incent our people to help our customers with optimization, because we believe, in the long run, that's the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers, when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workflow. That's sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we're taking every ",31,7
412,MSFT,23,3,"provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workflow. That's sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we're taking every opportunity to prove that out with customers in real time. The second thing I'd say is we do have new workloads started, because if you think about it, during the pandemic, it was all about new workloads and scaling workloads. But pre-pandemic, there was a balance between optimizations and new workloads. What we're seeing now is the new workloads start, in addition to highly intense optimization driven that we have. The third is perhaps more of a relative statement. Because of some of the ",31,15
413,MSFT,23,3,"have. The third is perhaps more of a relative statement. Because of some of the work we've done in Al even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations, whether it's coming to you in just OpenAl's APIs, right? If you think about the consumer tech companies that are all spinning essentially Azure meters, because they have gone to OpenAI and are using their API. These are not customers of Azure at all. Second, even Azure OpenAI API customers are all new and the workload conversations, whether it's B2C conversations in financial services, or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were ",32,2
414,MSFT,23,3,"conversations, whether it's B2C conversations in financial services, or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were not in the game in the past, whereas we now are. Those are the three comments I would make, both in terms of absolute macro, but more importantly, I think what is our relative market position and how it's being changed. AMY HOOD: That's maybe the one thing I would add to those comments, is we've been through almost a year where that pivot that Satya talked about from we're starting tons of new workloads - we'll call that the pandemic time - to this transition post, and we're coming to really the ",32,10
415,MSFT,23,3,"about from we're starting tons of new workloads - we'll call that the pandemic time - to this transition post, and we're coming to really the anniversary of that starting. And so, to Satya's point, we're continuing to incent optimization, but at some point, workloads just can't be optimized much further. And when you start to anniversary that, you do see that it gets a little bit easier in terms of the comps, year over year. And so, you even see that in a little bit of our guidance, some of that impact from a year-over-year basis. MARK MOERDLER: That was incredibly helpful. I really do appreciate it. Thank you for the color, and again, congratulations on what's happening. ",32,18
416,MSFT,23,3,"MARK MOERDLER: That was incredibly helpful. I really do appreciate it. Thank you for the color, and again, congratulations on what's happening. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. On Copilot monetization, can you just give us a sense of how this shows up, where we're going to see it? And ultimately, is there a simple price lift that you think you can get through a copilot, say 10%, 20%, 30% above where you saw the regular components of the suite, or is it too hard to factor in? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, overall, we do plan to monetize a separate set of ",33,6
417,MSFT,23,3,"of the suite, or is it too hard to factor in? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, overall, we do plan to monetize a separate set of meters across all of the tech stack, whether they're consumption meters or per-user subscriptions. The copilot that's priced, and it is there, is GitHub Copilot. That's a good example of incrementally how we monetize the price lists out there, and others are to be priced, because we are in preview mode. But you can expect us to do what we've done with GitHub Copilot pretty much across the board. AMY HOOD: Yeah, Brent, the best way of thinking about this is when we believe we're adding a lot of value, and frankly, that's what the copilots are ",33,14
418,MSFT,23,3,"AMY HOOD: Yeah, Brent, the best way of thinking about this is when we believe we're adding a lot of value, and frankly, that's what the copilots are doing and some productivity improvement, you can expect that we will have a list price for those. And you'll be able to look at that as we get to release. And to Satya's point, GitHub Copilot is a great example. BRENT THILL: Thanks. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Joe, we have the next question, please. (Operator Direction.) RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. And just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin ",34,1
419,MSFT,23,3,"RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. And just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin impact on Azure, can you just, Satya, maybe talk a little bit about how you see the cost of compute for AI workloads versus kind of the classic workloads? And how do you think that will evolve over time? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, a couple of things. One is clearly, the accelerated compute is what gets used to drive AI. And the thing that we are very, very focused on is to make sure that we get very efficient in the usage of those resources. If you think about sort of what a hyperscaler does is not just rack and stack sort of hardware. They use software to optimize the performance ",34,9
420,MSFT,23,3,"resources. If you think about sort of what a hyperscaler does is not just rack and stack sort of hardware. They use software to optimize the performance of a given workload, and in fact heterogeneous workloads on a given set of hardware. And so, we have many knobs that will continue to drive optimization across it. And you see it even for a given generation of a large model, where we start with the cost footprint to where we end in the cost footprint, even in a period of a quarter, changes. So, you can expect us to do what we have done over the decade plus the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads. ",34,17
421,MSFT,23,3,"done over the decade plus the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads. The other thing I would mention is that there are a lot of workloads now. One of the reasons why we got together with OpenAI primarily was we came out and said this type of workload, whether it's a training or an inference workload, is going to be much more generally relevant for us, not just in the context of Al. And so, you can see, I'll supply in other contexts as well. AMY HOOD: And Raimo, we talked a bit about this when we talked about the new Edge and the new Bing with analysts. And I think one of the ",35,5
422,MSFT,23,3,"AMY HOOD: And Raimo, we talked a bit about this when we talked about the new Edge and the new Bing with analysts. And I think one of the important things to keep in mind, which Satya is pointing to, is that it's not really just the cost of Azure and the ability to optimize across the Azure workloads. It's that really, even our first-party workloads and apps that are built are built on the same platform. And we're able, because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first party, as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first party, we're able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, Al services utilization across the stack. And so, it's not just sort of where Satya ",35,13
423,MSFT,23,3,"first party, we're able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, Al services utilization across the stack. And so, it's not just sort of where Satya wanted to see even a broader benefit of being a hyperscaler. RAIMO LENSCHOW: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please. KEITH BACHMAN, BMO: Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Amy, I wanted to address this to you, if I could. On your prepared remarks, you commented that you thought that operating expense growth would be lower. I was hoping to just maybe flush that out with some broader comments. Excuse me. ",35,21
424,MSFT,23,3,"expense growth would be lower. I was hoping to just maybe flush that out with some broader comments. Excuse me. Could you talk about how you see any kind of directional color on how you see gross margins evolving, given mix, and particularly supporting generative AI, and/or any other comments that might help shape our thinking as we begin to look at the operating margin for the next fiscal year? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith. And this is probably a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is you look at all of the businesses we're in, and we look about our competitiveness in those ",36,8
425,MSFT,23,3,"explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is you look at all of the businesses we're in, and we look about our competitiveness in those businesses. And this is where Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute. And I'll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains. Right now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that Satya's talking about with customers. And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that, while we continue to focus on our customers' success and getting a ton of value out of what we ",36,16
426,MSFT,23,3,"will be on continuing to take a growing share of that, while we continue to focus on our customers' success and getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that's the E5 product of Microsoft 365, whether that's Windows 365 to help. Maybe it's on compute costs and PC cost, whether it's working across the Azure stack. And so, with that opportunity plus in our consumer business, the largest number of active devices we've had in Windows that are still being used more, being able to focus on Edge share, and Bing share and gaming, bringing it to the PC as well as across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on, as we think about next year. ",37,4
427,MSFT,23,3,"bringing it to the PC as well as across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on, as we think about next year. And so, if we feel like, and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say great. And we want to be able to focus on investing in Al, which I talked about. We'll increase COGS growth, but we're committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low. And so, what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future, to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed. While I know that's not giving ",37,12
428,MSFT,23,3,"to show is our willingness to pivot to the future, to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed. While I know that's not giving specificity, it is in fact how we think about long-term success, is being well- positioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we're going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can. Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the buildout. We will charge for those AI capabilities, and then ultimately, we'll deliver operating profit. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think, as shareholders, you may want to look at is ",37,20
429,MSFT,23,3,"SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think, as shareholders, you may want to look at is what's the opportunity set ahead when we have a differentiated play to go after that opportunity set, which we believe we have, both the opportunity set in terms of TAM is bigger, and our differentiation at the very start of a cycle, we feel we have a good lead, and we have differentiated offerings up and down the stack. And so, therefore, that's the sort of approach we're going to take, which is how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all, as shareholders, long term? That's sort of where we look at it. And we'll ",38,6
430,MSFT,23,3,"how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all, as shareholders, long term? That's sort of where we look at it. And we'll manage the P&L carefully, driving operating leverage in a disciplined way, but not being shy of investing where we need to invest, in order to grab the long-term opportunity. And so, obviously we will see share gains first, usage first, then GM, then OPInc, right, like a classic P&L flow, but we feel good about our position. KEITH BACHMAN: All right, many thanks for the answer. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks. We've had a lot of questions on Al and ",38,14
431,MSFT,23,3,"BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks. We've had a lot of questions on Al and Azure, so maybe just to round it out, just on the Office 365 business, Amy, 16% constant currency guide for June, not really seeing much seat degradation despite obviously a tight labor market. So, it's proven to be very resilient. Could you just unpack the sensitivity to that headcount reduction, given that across your customer base, at least slower rate of hiring, just given that this is an enormous seat based business, it doesn't seem to be showing up? Maybe you could just help us understand what's driving that continued seat ",39,1
432,MSFT,23,3,"this is an enormous seat based business, it doesn't seem to be showing up? Maybe you could just help us understand what's driving that continued seat growth and how durable that is. AMY HOOD: Yeah. Thanks, Karl. I think I would step back and say we have seen, I mean, the Office 365 suite, but broadly, the Microsoft 365 suite adds a ton of value for users. And so, if you think about the users and on the global base, we've been able to add users, which you continue to see, we still have in the frontline scenario and an SMB opportunity to continue to grow. And in the enterprise, where we are a basic productivity tool, the labor market is still tight in those places. And we continue to see customers ",39,9
433,MSFT,23,3,"grow. And in the enterprise, where we are a basic productivity tool, the labor market is still tight in those places. And we continue to see customers committed to the value they're getting. And so, this is not something that I think our focus has really been on continuing to get healthy renewals, continuing to add new products and renewal where it makes sense to save customers money and increase value. And so, I think that's the story of the resilience you're seeing. And, of course, we did have a good E5 quarter, which you're starting to see, and it helps on RPU. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please. ",39,17

Nice to see continued resilience in the business. I wanted to get back to the topic of AI, but think maybe a little bit longer term. How are you thinking about the potential for regulation around AI, some of the concerns around data, and customer privacy and governance? And what do you think you can do to maybe quell some of those fears that governments, and customers and organizations have around that? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. Thanks, Rishi, for the question. Overall, we've ",40,3
435,MSFT,23,3,"governments, and customers and organizations have around that? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. Thanks, Rishi, for the question. Overall, we've taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up. We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that, from day one, we think about as first class, and build into our engineering process all the safeguards. For example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles. We translated the AI principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process, that then we hold ourselves to internal audit, essentially. That's the framework we have. ",40,11
436,MSFT,23,3,"translated into an implementation process, that then we hold ourselves to internal audit, essentially. That's the framework we have. We have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are, and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process. And so, we feel very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there. And so, we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction. But quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in the AI, I think we stand to gain from that. ",40,19
437,MSFT,23,3,"trust as a differentiated position in the AI, I think we stand to gain from that. RISHI JALURIA: All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Rishi. Joe, we have time for one last question. MICHAEL TURRIN, Wells Fargo: Hey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in. I want to ask a question on the consolidation play that Microsoft is positioned for, given that's something we hear clearly top of mind for IP decision makers currently. You have clear plays across security infrastructure apps in other areas. So, it would just be great to hear your view on the Microsoft consolidation playbook in the current environment, ",41,7
438,MSFT,23,3,"infrastructure apps in other areas. So, it would just be great to hear your view on the Microsoft consolidation playbook in the current environment, and if there are certain areas you're particularly focused on or seeing the most traction around. Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, I'll start, and then, Amy, you can add. I think Amy referenced this in the context of Microsoft 365 and Office 365, but fundamentally, what we're focused on is making sure that the customers are able to derive the value out of our offerings, whether it's the Microsoft 365 suite value, which is significant, whether it's E3 or E5. And we want to make sure that they're getting deployed, they're getting used. And ",41,15
439,MSFT,23,3,"Microsoft 365 suite value, which is significant, whether it's E3 or E5. And we want to make sure that they're getting deployed, they're getting used. And that's obviously going to lead to our share gains in many cases. Same thing in security. That's a place where this quarter, you saw some good results from us. And same all up and down the stack across Azure. When you think about AI, the anatomy of an AI application is not just an AI model. In fact, ChatGPT itself is a great example. ChatGPT, for example, uses Cosmos DB as their core database. And so, therefore, we want to make sure that our services, as they are competitive, get used together, whether it's the IaaS layer, or the PaaS layer, or the SaaS layer. ",42,2
440,MSFT,23,3,"that our services, as they are competitive, get used together, whether it's the IaaS layer, or the PaaS layer, or the SaaS layer. AMY HOOD: And maybe one thing I would add, Michael, is that I know the question is consolidation, but another aspect of that is that some of the new business process automation work that's going to get done, whether that's the Dynamics workloads that we've talked about, it also will benefit from having the AI services available in Azure, from having the core Azure capabilities, as well actually some front end stuff that people are buying in Microsoft 365 to close these loops in a new way. And so, I think maybe it's not the traditional definition of consolidation, but ",42,10
441,MSFT,23,3,"Microsoft 365 to close these loops in a new way.
